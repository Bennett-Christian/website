                        <p>This is a personal website created to share files between friends and family members. Some people may have friends or relatives who live in a different city far away from them. It is important to have a reliable and easy way to transfer files across these great distances to allow these people to share every moment they choose.<br><br> Despite this, file sizes of things such as long videos or high-quality photos can often be too large to send via text or email. With the most accessible form of data transfer not working on these large files, it can cause some of the biggest family moments to go unshared.<br><br> Beyond text or email, other file transfer services do exist, but many of them charge a premium in order to exceed certain file size limits as well. In addition to the cost, it is also common for third-party file transfer services to be difficult to use or understand, especially for some of the less technologically literate friends or family members people may have.<br><br> For that reason, there is no need to sign up for an account of any sort when using this site, users must simply follow the instructions on each data transfer page in order to upload or download files.<br><br> With all that being said, this site has been created in order to alleviate the issues of file size, transfer cost and ease of use, making sure to give everybody the freedom to share anything from anywhere.</p>
